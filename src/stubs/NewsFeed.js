As the following overview of the burgeoning crypto-game industry will show, it may be some time before the third category becomes dominant…</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A quick history lesson</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Crypto-based games already have a modest history, even if they only became popular at the end of last year with CryptoKitties, the cat-breeding game that uses the Ethereum blockchain to trade and prove ownership of the titular crypto-cats. The first title that could legitimately be called a ‘crypto-game’ was <a href="http://www.dragons.tl/bitcoins.php" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Dragon’s Tale</a>, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that allowed players to stake actual Bitcoin on the outcome of a variety of minigames. Launched on July 12, 2013 as a beta but first conceived in <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1392.0" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">2010</a> by games developer Andrew Tepper,  Dragon’s Tale is set in a open 3D world where players could hunt for eggs, tip cows, catch fish, and race monkeys, among other mini-games. It may not have used Bitcoin in any more imaginative way than as a virtual gambling chip, but it at least showed that the worlds of cryptocurrencies and video games could be mixed, and it continues to be played to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="Dragon’s Tale" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/a7547d5f8fa8272496bf8d550e09c3e0.png" title="Dragon’s Tale"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><em>The fantastical open world of Dragon’s Tale. © eGenesis</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An even more significant early game was Huntercoin, another MMORPG first emerging as a prototype in <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=300538.0" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">September 2013</a>. Running on a fork of the Namecoin blockchain, it saw players mining the game’s own cryptocurrency (HUC) by finding its coins in the game world and then bringing them to one of several randomly generated ‘banks,’ which would actually transfer them to the players’ crypto-wallets. It has had something of a turbulent ride since it first appeared, with co-creator Mikhail Syndeev passing away in February 2014 and its code being transferred into the upstream Bitcoin core code in 2016, but the game is still popular, providing a testament to the enduring appeal of its decentralized game world and mechanics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, since it has been demonstrated that games could be left to run without being subject to direct control from a centralized server, the rest of the gaming world has been slow to catch up. Predictably enough, there were a slew of Bitcoin-based gambling websites in both 2013 and 2014, such as SatoshiDice, BitZino, Bitino, and Bit777 – although these weren’t really video games as such. There were also a number of tokens that were briefly provided as a reward for playing certain online games, such as the HYPER cryptocurrency that was offered in mid-2014 with the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/multiplayer_games_open_to_cryptocurrencies_in_big_way">Counter Strike</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hyper-launches-minecraft-server-open-beta">Minecraft</a> servers the currency’s team launched. But for a while, there were few games designed specifically with a cryptocurrency or blockchain in mind, although 2015 finally provided a modest increase in the number of games based around offering cryptocurrencies as a reward for play or as a means of payment. Such games included multiplayer racer <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/turbocharge-gamecredits-altcoin-first-videogame-countdown-to-next-race-with-new-web-wallet-launch">TurboCharged</a>, platformer <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitlanders.FlapPig" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">FlapPig</a>, and fellow platformer <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sarutobi/id932194840?mt=8" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">SaruTobi</a>. Like the games that came before and after them, these titles were all ‘free-to-play’, although most offered in-app purchases. While they once again didn’t use cryptocurrency technology in particularly imaginative ways, their increasing numbers at least suggested that the idea of using cryptocurrencies in video games was a popular one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This appeared to be the case, as 2016 witnessed another upsurge in the use of cryptocurrencies and blockchains in gaming. Aside from the increasing amount of games offering Bitcoin rewards, for example <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/play-grabbit-and-earn-bitcoins">Grabbit</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/kill-monsters-get-bitcoin-minecraft-server-releases-version-20-opens-up-satoshi-town">BitQuest</a>, there was the release of the popular card-trading game <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-blockchain-based-spells-of-genesis-approaches-launch-bitcrystals-price-rises">Spells of Genesis</a> in September of that year. Developed by the Swiss-based EverdreamSoft and using its own BitCrystals (BCY) currency, it provided a turning point because it actually used the Bitcoin blockchain to store – and to guarantee the authenticity of – the collectable cards it enabled players to win. This breakthrough was built upon in 2017, when the trading-card game <a href="http://www.fowtcg.com/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Force of Will</a> and real-time strategy game <a href="https://www.beyond-the-void.net/wiki/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Beyond the Void</a> were both launched. First released as an <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/kill-monsters-get-bitcoin-minecraft-server-releases-version-20-opens-up-satoshi-town">open beta in April 2017</a>, the latter game used the Ethereum blockchain to run its own Nexium (NXC) cryptocurrency. Significantly, this use would be repeated by the now-famous CryptoKitties, which became the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptokitties-becomes-largest-ethereum-based-decentralized-application">largest Dapp on Ethereum</a> a mere week after its launch on November 28.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/3465fac416db58824154da19a053e01e.jpg"></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>AllMine? Or all theirs?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite CryptoKitties providing a proof-of-concept in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptokitties-sales-hit-12-million-could-be-ethereums-killer-app-after-all">December 2017</a> that blockchain and cryptocurrencies could be exploited to deliver a novel gaming experience – for example the breeding/trading of unique digital pets, the most common use of cryptocurrencies in games today still revolves around rewarding players for their gaming efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is most evident in <a href="https://www.allmine.cash/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">AllMine</a>, a match-three puzzle game à la Candy Crush due for release on PC in Q3 2018. Developed by Californian startup MyDream Interactive, the game consists in three interrelated sub-games, with the first (mini-game based) sub-game earning players the right to play in the second, mining sub-game. As the name suggests, players who participate in the mining game essentially permit their computer to be used to mine Jewel, the cryptocurrency created especially for AllMine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="AllMine" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/235a2265fb5d4573dcaf3d663e650563.png" title="AllMine"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><em>Players have to line up matching icons in AllMine © MyDream Interactive</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of the proceeds of this mining – which is much less resource-intensive than <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/mining">Bitcoin mining</a> – will go to the players themselves, while the other part will go to the developers, who will reinvest their share back into the game in various ways – including developing updates and offering Jewelz as an incentive to certain players to keep mining/playing. Players will have the option of trading their Jewelz for other cryptocurrencies or for fiat money, but here\'s where it gets interesting, because they will also be able to use their coins to fund purchases in the third sub-game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This third sub-game involves building "Utopias" (farmstead-esque settlements) and populating them with "Adoraboos," – cute mythical creatures that players collect during the mining sub-game and that can be fed and entertained. Not only can players level up their Utopias, but they can actually challenge – Pokémon style – other players to battles. The winner of these battles is rewarded with a level up for their Utopia, while the loser is rewarded with no level up and having their Utopia becoming inaccessible for three days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="Adoraboo" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/49a212106691d96f2d780b5df7830119.png" title="Adoraboo"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><em>Catching an Adoraboo ©MyDream Interactive</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, so generic, but the interesting – or arguably manipulative – part is that players who upgrade their Utopias more will have a greater chance of winning these battles and becoming the kind of \'Pokémaster\' (or rather, Adoraboo-master) their friends will envy. Of course, the only way to upgrade your Utopia is to spend the Jewelz you earn, which essentially means that the most engaged AllMine players won\'t be earning much profit from playing the game, since the proceeds of their mining exploits will mostly be pumped back into transforming their Utopias into formidable fighting machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar reward systems – which dangle a crypto-shaped carrot in front of gamers only to whip them with a purchase-shaped stick – can be increasingly found elsewhere. For example, the March-released <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.stage.game.itadaki&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Itadaki Dungeon</a> is a top-down 2D adventure in which players can find and earn mBTC (milli-bitcoin), but which also offers in-app purchases of various items for those players who wish to increase their chances of progressing in the game. Likewise, <a href="https://realityclash.com/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Reality Clash</a> – which is due for release in "late 2018" – is a first person shooter (FPS) in which "<a href="https://www.realwire.com/releases/Reality-Clash-in-game-cryptocurrency-leaps-380-as-armoury-store-opens" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">gamers can make real cash</a>" via the weapons they sell for Reality Clash Gold Coins (RCC). However, they unfortunately have to purchase RCC in the first place in order to buy these weapons, something which suggests that the overall balance of purchases and sales will end up in the Reality Gaming Group\'s favour.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><img alt="" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/b790494a72732b9c67932e13fd077a42.jpg"></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Bitcoin bandwagon</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, nameable games that offer crypto rewards and are either available now or soon-to-be-launched are in short supply – <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mansoon.cryptopop" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">CryptoPop</a> is another example – with some early examples having ceased paying out in cryptocurrencies altogether, such as the Swiss-made <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bitcoinbandit.jetpack&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Bitcoin Bandit</a>. That said, they\'re likely to be abundant in the near future, given the number of companies offering platforms that will enable games developers to add crypto-reward systems to their products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Japanese internet services corporation GMO recently announced that its "<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/japanese-internet-giant-gmo-to-launch-in-game-bitcoin-rewards-system-this-summer">Bitcoin-based application for in-game rewards</a>" would be released in August, with one game – <a href="https://whimsicalwar.com/en/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Whimsical War</a> – already lined up to utilize this app once it\'s launched. Similarly, Kik <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/kik-app-to-partner-with-unity-technologies-to-spread-token-to-mainstream-gaming">teamed up</a> with Unity Technologies in March to develop a software development kit (SDK) for its Kin cryptocurrency, thereby enabling any games developer to use Kin as an in-game reward token.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is also something that will be possible via the upcoming <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/one-coin-to-play-them-all-a-startup-to-make-in-game-digital-currency-available-on-multiple-platforms">Tap Project</a> and <a href="https://www.nitro.live/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Nitro</a> platforms, the latter of which <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-platform-that-makes-every-participant-stakeholder-in-video-games-marketplace">aims</a> to tokenize the entire gaming industry ecosystem, as well as provide specific in-game rewards for players via the NOX cryptocurrency. Through platforms like it, the video game industry would have its initial coin offering (ICO) moment, with developers being given access to a broader range of funding and financing – often from players – than they may have enjoyed in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, for every developer or company hoping to create a crypto-based ecosystem for games that rewards players and developers alike, there are those who simply seem to be cashing in on the prevailing crypto-hype. Much like <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nasdaq-will-delist-former-beverage-company-long-blockchain-corp">Long Blockchain Corp.</a>, some have simply added a Bitcoin or crypto association as a way of garnering extra interest, even if this addition doesn\'t make much sense gameplay-wise. In January, for instance, the action-RPG Imperatum introduced a fashionably named "<a href="https://imperatumgame.com/crypto-update/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Crypto Update</a>" that equipped it with a "Bitcoin Mode," whereby item drops become more frequent and enemies become more fiendish if the value of BTC increases. As \'novel\' as this might seem at first glance, it would potentially destroy the game\'s enjoyability if BTC\'s price collapsed or if it rose to lunar highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="Imperatum" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/12fd313c3358779a4a5eda93edf48737.jpg" title="Imperatum"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><em>Imperatum screenshot ©Pro Social Games LLC</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April, SuperFly Games Ltd did something comparable with their <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SuperFlyGames.CryptoRider&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Crypto Rider</a>, a 2D driving game in which players can race along the historical price charts of various cryptocurrencies and which gained its fair share of <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22crypto+rider%22+game&amp;oq=%22crypto&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l3j69i65l3.5645j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">press attention</a>. Its peaks and troughs prove fun for a while, but like Imperatum it incorporates nothing of the essential workings of blockchains and cryptocurrencies into its own inner workings, unless you think volatile price fluctuations are essential to Bitcoin et al.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another game that jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon for promotional purposes was puzzler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/768750/MonteCrypto_The_Bitcoin_Enigma/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Montecrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma</a>, which upon its February launch <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-steam-game-offers-one-bitcoin-to-first-player-who-cracks-24-enigmas">promised</a> exactly one Bitcoin (then worth $9,860) to the first player able to solve its 24 head-scratching puzzles. This may have been a very welcome reward for the team that eventually <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/768750/announcements/detail/3277933988991737830" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">managed</a> this feat on April 24 (when BTC was worth approx. $9,566),  but it\'s clear that once again, this one-off payment had little or nothing to do with the game itself, which continues to be playable today without any crypto reward.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><img alt="" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/73a229a3a286379ec15112c676577bb2.jpg"></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Human mining</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that the above two sections outline how cryptocurrencies have been used by developers largely for rewards/incentives or for marketing – a use also common <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-prizes-on-the-rise-magical-marketing-or-another-scam">outside</a> of video games, there may seem to be little hope for those who\'d like to see the actual technology of cryptocurrencies worked meaningfully into a video game. Fortunately, there are some signs that this technology has been making a difference to the intrinsic gameplay and workings of some games, and may do this to a greater extent in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To begin with, there\'s the painfully familiar <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">CryptoKitties</a>, which wouldn\'t be quite the same without the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum blockchain</a>, since it uses the latter to ensure that the digital cats players breed are entirely unique, "100 percent owned" by the player, and cannot be reproduced, erased, or seized. There\'s also the very similar <a href="https://cryptofighters.io/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">CryptoFighters</a>, not to mention <a href="https://unicorngo.io/en" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">UnicornGo</a> and Tencent\'s <a href="https://qz.com/1260192/tencents-blockchain-game-merges-cryptokitties-and-pokemon-go/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Let\'s Hunt Monsters</a>, which is much the same except for the fact that players battle with their unique fighters, and have to purchase them from the official marketplace – making the game another example of a crypto-enabled cash cow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for games which use blockchains and cryptocurrencies in order to furnish something other than unique characters owned entirely by players, examples are currently still few and far between. However, one indie game offers hope that the developers of the future will occasionally have original ideas as to how cryptocurrencies can be merged with video games. This is the aforementioned <a href="http://huntercoin.org/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Huntercoin</a>, a hybrid cryptocurrency/decentralized MMORPG that was released to the public in February 2014 by hobbyist developers, and which continues to generate low-level cultish buzz due to its unique dynamics. What distinguishes it is that it provides the first ever example of \'human mining,\' in that players mine its currency (HUC) by travelling across the massively multiplayer online (MMO) game world and finding it. It also provides the first example of a truly decentralized game server, with the developers unable to influence the game’s unfolding except by changing the underlying code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="Huntercoin" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/98d0827a5f34a4ca3f4929cb4947e41b.jpg" title="Huntercoin"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><em>© huntercoin.org</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to its hobbyist origins and decentralised existence as a fork of the Namecoin blockchain, Huntercoin was initially laggy and a touch buggy, yet it shows that it\'s possible to insert blockchain and cryptocurrencies into the very core of a video game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether the gaming industry makes good on its early promise is still an open question, however, but with the growing prevalence and popularity of such games as CryptoKitties, AllMine, Blockchain Game, and Huntercoin, cryptocurrencies could one day become an integral part of video gaming\'s fabric.</p>\r\n',

There were also a number of tokens that were briefly provided as a reward for playing certain online games, such as the HYPER cryptocurrency that was offered in mid-2014 with the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/multiplayer_games_open_to_cryptocurrencies_in_big_way">Counter Strike</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hyper-launches-minecraft-server-open-beta">Minecraft</a> servers the currency’s team launched. But for a while, there were few games designed specifically with a cryptocurrency or blockchain in mind, although 2015 finally provided a modest increase in the number of games based around offering cryptocurrencies as a reward for play or as a means of payment. Such games included multiplayer racer <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/turbocharge-gamecredits-altcoin-first-videogame-countdown-to-next-race-with-new-web-wallet-launch">TurboCharged</a>, platformer <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitlanders.FlapPig" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">FlapPig</a>, and fellow platformer <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sarutobi/id932194840?mt=8" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">SaruTobi</a>. Like the games that came before and after them, these titles were all ‘free-to-play’, although most offered in-app purchases. While they once again didn’t use cryptocurrency technology in particularly imaginative ways, their increasing numbers at least suggested that the idea of using cryptocurrencies in video games was a popular one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This appeared to be the case, as 2016 witnessed another upsurge in the use of cryptocurrencies and blockchains in gaming. Aside from the increasing amount of games offering Bitcoin rewards, for example <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/play-grabbit-and-earn-bitcoins">Grabbit</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/kill-monsters-get-bitcoin-minecraft-server-releases-version-20-opens-up-satoshi-town">BitQuest</a>, there was the release of the popular card-trading game <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-blockchain-based-spells-of-genesis-approaches-launch-bitcrystals-price-rises">Spells of Genesis</a> in September of that year. Developed by the Swiss-based EverdreamSoft and using its own BitCrystals (BCY) currency, it provided a turning point because it actually used the Bitcoin blockchain to store – and to guarantee the authenticity of – the collectable cards it enabled players to win. This breakthrough was built upon in 2017, when the trading-card game <a href="http://www.fowtcg.com/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Force of Will</a> and real-time strategy game <a href="https://www.beyond-the-void.net/wiki/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Beyond the Void</a> were both launched. First released as an <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/kill-monsters-get-bitcoin-minecraft-server-releases-version-20-opens-up-satoshi-town">open beta in April 2017</a>, the latter game used the Ethereum blockchain to run its own Nexium (NXC) cryptocurrency. Significantly, this use would be repeated by the now-famous CryptoKitties, which became the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptokitties-becomes-largest-ethereum-based-decentralized-application">largest Dapp on Ethereum</a> a mere week after its launch on November 28.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/3465fac416db58824154da19a053e01e.jpg"></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>AllMine? Or all theirs?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite CryptoKitties providing a proof-of-concept in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptokitties-sales-hit-12-million-could-be-ethereums-killer-app-after-all">December 2017</a> that blockchain and cryptocurrencies could be exploited to deliver a novel gaming experience – for example the breeding/trading of unique digital pets, the most common use of cryptocurrencies in games today still revolves around rewarding players for their gaming efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is most evident in <a href="https://www.allmine.cash/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">AllMine</a>, a match-three puzzle game à la Candy Crush due for release on PC in Q3 2018. Developed by Californian startup MyDream Interactive, the game consists in three interrelated sub-games, with the first (mini-game based) sub-game earning players the right to play in the second, mining sub-game. As the name suggests, players who participate in the mining game essentially permit their computer to be used to mine Jewel, the cryptocurrency created especially for AllMine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="AllMine" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/235a2265fb5d4573dcaf3d663e650563.png" title="AllMine"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><em>Players have to line up matching icons in AllMine © MyDream Interactive</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of the proceeds of this mining – which is much less resource-intensive than <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/mining">Bitcoin mining</a> – will go to the players themselves, while the other part will go to the developers, who will reinvest their share back into the game in various ways – including developing updates and offering Jewelz as an incentive to certain players to keep mining/playing. Players will have the option of trading their Jewelz for other cryptocurrencies or for fiat money, but here\'s where it gets interesting, because they will also be able to use their coins to fund purchases in the third sub-game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This third sub-game involves building "Utopias" (farmstead-esque settlements) and populating them with "Adoraboos," – cute mythical creatures that players collect during the mining sub-game and that can be fed and entertained. Not only can players level up their Utopias, but they can actually challenge – Pokémon style – other players to battles. The winner of these battles is rewarded with a level up for their Utopia, while the loser is rewarded with no level up and having their Utopia becoming inaccessible for three days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="Adoraboo" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/49a212106691d96f2d780b5df7830119.png" title="Adoraboo"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><em>Catching an Adoraboo ©MyDream Interactive</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, so generic, but the interesting – or arguably manipulative – part is that players who upgrade their Utopias more will have a greater chance of winning these battles and becoming the kind of \'Pokémaster\' (or rather, Adoraboo-master) their friends will envy. Of course, the only way to upgrade your Utopia is to spend the Jewelz you earn, which essentially means that the most engaged AllMine players won\'t be earning much profit from playing the game, since the proceeds of their mining exploits will mostly be pumped back into transforming their Utopias into formidable fighting machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar reward systems – which dangle a crypto-shaped carrot in front of gamers only to whip them with a purchase-shaped stick – can be increasingly found elsewhere. For example, the March-released <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.stage.game.itadaki&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Itadaki Dungeon</a> is a top-down 2D adventure in which players can find and earn mBTC (milli-bitcoin), but which also offers in-app purchases of various items for those players who wish to increase their chances of progressing in the game. Likewise, <a href="https://realityclash.com/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Reality Clash</a> – which is due for release in "late 2018" – is a first person shooter (FPS) in which "<a href="https://www.realwire.com/releases/Reality-Clash-in-game-cryptocurrency-leaps-380-as-armoury-store-opens" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">gamers can make real cash</a>" via the weapons they sell for Reality Clash Gold Coins (RCC). However, they unfortunately have to purchase RCC in the first place in order to buy these weapons, something which suggests that the overall balance of purchases and sales will end up in the Reality Gaming Group\'s favour.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><img alt="" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/b790494a72732b9c67932e13fd077a42.jpg"></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Bitcoin bandwagon</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, nameable games that offer crypto rewards and are either available now or soon-to-be-launched are in short supply – <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mansoon.cryptopop" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">CryptoPop</a> is another example – with some early examples having ceased paying out in cryptocurrencies altogether, such as the Swiss-made <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bitcoinbandit.jetpack&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Bitcoin Bandit</a>. That said, they\'re likely to be abundant in the near future, given the number of companies offering platforms that will enable games developers to add crypto-reward systems to their products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Japanese internet services corporation GMO recently announced that its "<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/japanese-internet-giant-gmo-to-launch-in-game-bitcoin-rewards-system-this-summer">Bitcoin-based application for in-game rewards</a>" would be released in August, with one game – <a href="https://whimsicalwar.com/en/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Whimsical War</a> – already lined up to utilize this app once it\'s launched. Similarly, Kik <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/kik-app-to-partner-with-unity-technologies-to-spread-token-to-mainstream-gaming">teamed up</a> with Unity Technologies in March to develop a software development kit (SDK) for its Kin cryptocurrency, thereby enabling any games developer to use Kin as an in-game reward token.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is also something that will be possible via the upcoming <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/one-coin-to-play-them-all-a-startup-to-make-in-game-digital-currency-available-on-multiple-platforms">Tap Project</a> and <a href="https://www.nitro.live/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Nitro</a> platforms, the latter of which <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-platform-that-makes-every-participant-stakeholder-in-video-games-marketplace">aims</a> to tokenize the entire gaming industry ecosystem, as well as provide specific in-game rewards for players via the NOX cryptocurrency. Through platforms like it, the video game industry would have its initial coin offering (ICO) moment, with developers being given access to a broader range of funding and financing – often from players – than they may have enjoyed in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, for every developer or company hoping to create a crypto-based ecosystem for games that rewards players and developers alike, there are those who simply seem to be cashing in on the prevailing crypto-hype. Much like <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nasdaq-will-delist-former-beverage-company-long-blockchain-corp">Long Blockchain Corp.</a>, some have simply added a Bitcoin or crypto association as a way of garnering extra interest, even if this addition doesn\'t make much sense gameplay-wise. In January, for instance, the action-RPG Imperatum introduced a fashionably named "<a href="https://imperatumgame.com/crypto-update/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Crypto Update</a>" that equipped it with a "Bitcoin Mode," whereby item drops become more frequent and enemies become more fiendish if the value of BTC increases. As \'novel\' as this might seem at first glance, it would potentially destroy the game\'s enjoyability if BTC\'s price collapsed or if it rose to lunar highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="Imperatum" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/12fd313c3358779a4a5eda93edf48737.jpg" title="Imperatum"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><em>Imperatum screenshot ©Pro Social Games LLC</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April, SuperFly Games Ltd did something comparable with their <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SuperFlyGames.CryptoRider&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Crypto Rider</a>, a 2D driving game in which players can race along the historical price charts of various cryptocurrencies and which gained its fair share of <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22crypto+rider%22+game&amp;oq=%22crypto&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l3j69i65l3.5645j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">press attention</a>. Its peaks and troughs prove fun for a while, but like Imperatum it incorporates nothing of the essential workings of blockchains and cryptocurrencies into its own inner workings, unless you think volatile price fluctuations are essential to Bitcoin et al.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another game that jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon for promotional purposes was puzzler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/768750/MonteCrypto_The_Bitcoin_Enigma/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Montecrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma</a>, which upon its February launch <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-steam-game-offers-one-bitcoin-to-first-player-who-cracks-24-enigmas">promised</a> exactly one Bitcoin (then worth $9,860) to the first player able to solve its 24 head-scratching puzzles. This may have been a very welcome reward for the team that eventually <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/768750/announcements/detail/3277933988991737830" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">managed</a> this feat on April 24 (when BTC was worth approx. $9,566),  but it\'s clear that once again, this one-off payment had little or nothing to do with the game itself, which continues to be playable today without any crypto reward.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><img alt="" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/73a229a3a286379ec15112c676577bb2.jpg"></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Human mining</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that the above two sections outline how cryptocurrencies have been used by developers largely for rewards/incentives or for marketing – a use also common <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-prizes-on-the-rise-magical-marketing-or-another-scam">outside</a> of video games, there may seem to be little hope for those who\'d like to see the actual technology of cryptocurrencies worked meaningfully into a video game. Fortunately, there are some signs that this technology has been making a difference to the intrinsic gameplay and workings of some games, and may do this to a greater extent in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To begin with, there\'s the painfully familiar <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">CryptoKitties</a>, which wouldn\'t be quite the same without the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum blockchain</a>, since it uses the latter to ensure that the digital cats players breed are entirely unique, "100 percent owned" by the player, and cannot be reproduced, erased, or seized. There\'s also the very similar <a href="https://cryptofighters.io/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">CryptoFighters</a>, not to mention <a href="https://unicorngo.io/en" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">UnicornGo</a> and Tencent\'s <a href="https://qz.com/1260192/tencents-blockchain-game-merges-cryptokitties-and-pokemon-go/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Let\'s Hunt Monsters</a>, which is much the same except for the fact that players battle with their unique fighters, and have to purchase them from the official marketplace – making the game another example of a crypto-enabled cash cow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for games which use blockchains and cryptocurrencies in order to furnish something other than unique characters owned entirely by players, examples are currently still few and far between. However, one indie game offers hope that the developers of the future will occasionally have original ideas as to how cryptocurrencies can be merged with video games. This is the aforementioned <a href="http://huntercoin.org/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">Huntercoin</a>, a hybrid cryptocurrency/decentralized MMORPG that was released to the public in February 2014 by hobbyist developers, and which continues to generate low-level cultish buzz due to its unique dynamics. What distinguishes it is that it provides the first ever example of \'human mining,\' in that players mine its currency (HUC) by travelling across the massively multiplayer online (MMO) game world and finding it. It also provides the first example of a truly decentralized game server, with the developers unable to influence the game’s unfolding except by changing the underlying code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><img alt="Huntercoin" src="https://cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/98d0827a5f34a4ca3f4929cb4947e41b.jpg" title="Huntercoin"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><em>© huntercoin.org</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to its hobbyist origins and decentralised existence as a fork of the Namecoin blockchain, Huntercoin was initially laggy and a touch buggy, yet it shows that it\'s possible to insert blockchain and cryptocurrencies into the very core of a video game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether the gaming industry makes good on its early promise is still an open question, however, but with the growing prevalence and popularity of such games as CryptoKitties, AllMine, Blockchain Game, and Huntercoin, cryptocurrencies could one day become an integral part of video gaming\'s fabric.</p>\r\n',

The Monero cryptocurrency provides anonymity without tumbling services due to its privacy centric design, utilizing ring signatures to keep the entire blockchain secure and untraceable. He pointed to the need for adopting crypto regulations at an EU and maybe even at a G-20 level to have mixing services recognized as money-laundering and tax evasion indicators, with users of mixing services assumed to be guilty of these offenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The power to levy taxes, including cryptocurrency taxes, is central to the sovereignty of EU Member States, which have assigned only limited competences to the EU in this area.  The EU lacks a uniform tax regulator. Therefore, aggressive tax planning by multinational crypto-businesses is monitored by the EU Anti-Trust Commission which is in charge of policing state aid that skews competition within the EU.  Ricardo Cardoso spokesperson handling Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s portfolio said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“The Commission has no ongoing investigations concerning cryptocurrency related issues and we would never speculate on such matters.”</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Accordingly, TAX3 was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/illicit-uses-of-cryptocurrency-gaining-attention-around-the-world-expert-take">established</a> by the European Parliament on March 1, 2018 in response to continued revelations over the last five years via LuxLeaks, the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers which shed light on the rampant tax evasion, money laundering and corruption at EU Member States, that have independent citizenship programs, tax and policies. As Dariusz Rosati MEP, EPP Group Spokesman in the Special Committee on Financial Crimes, Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance, said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“For me, selling EU citizenship does not only mean enabling the rich to free-ride on our common European assets. It also allows the rich to escape sanctions or launder money. Take the example of Malta which uses citizenship in exchange for investments program to attract investments, where rich Russian citizens - who potentially could be targeted by further sanctions - are amongst the nationalities that most frequently receive Maltese - therefore European - citizenship.”</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">TAX3’s mission is to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir="ltr">\n<li>Contribute to the ongoing debate on taxation of the digital economy, including VAT;</li>\r\n\t<li>Assess national schemes providing tax privileges (such as sale of citizenship programs);</li>\r\n\t<li>Follow closely the ongoing work of, and contribution by, the Commission and Member States in international institutions, including the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), G20, UN and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) regarding taxation/cryptocurrency matters.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The TAX3 Committee has a twelve-month mandate. At the end of this period, it will submit a report with findings and recommendations to do more to fight tax crimes, tax evasion and tax avoidance in EU to set the stage for fairness in tax competition with many EU Member States.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Investigations –like TAX3--could lead to a lasting split in cryptocurrency markets, as exchanges face the choice of whether to comply with mounting regulatory demands” cautioned Cornell professor and computer scientist Emin Gun Sirer who is the co-founder of a peer-to-peer virtual currency system called Karma, which pre-dates Bitcoin by seven years.  “Exchanges will go one of two ways,” Sirer said. “Either they will clean their act, by first shopping for the most lenient jurisdictions with relevant KYC/AML and tax laws or they\'ll go ‘fully underground,’ and operate with no rules, behind Tor and other anonymous communication technologies” with mixing capabilities to evade KYC/AML and tax laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, many exchanges from Asia and EU after shopping around for the most tax and regulatory lenient crypto jurisdiction have set up shop in Malta.  As a result, according to a study conducted by Morgan Stanley, Malta now accounts for the largest share of cryptocurrency trading volume in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Malta is a global trailblazer in crypto blockchain and ICO regulation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Malta\'s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has described his country as the global trailblazer in the regulation of blockchain-based businesses and the jurisdiction of quality and choice for world class fintech companies.  Muscat ties Malta’s success to becoming a member of EU’s Blockchain Partnership; it’s three new cryptocurrency bills  adopted by parliament on April 24; as well as it’s favorable crypto tax policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bills grant regulatory power to the Malta Financial Services Authority  to publish and enforce specific rules regarding cryptocurrencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Malta Digital Innovation Authority Bill.</strong> It establishes the Malta Digital Innovation Authority, which on a voluntary basis, will certify blockchain platforms to ensure credibility and provide legal assurances regarding cryptocurrencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Innovative Technology Arrangements Bill.</strong> It provides a framework for the registration of technology service providers and the certification of technology arrangements concerning system administrators and auditors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Services and Virtual Financial Asset Bill.</strong> It provides the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cryptocurrencies are currently unregulated under Maltese law and exchanges of cryptocurrencies are deemed equivalent to commodity trading. A company utilizing  cryptocurrencies isn\'t required to obtain a license from the Malta Financial Services Authority unless it qualifies as a collective investment scheme or carries on the business of a financial institution or payment service provider, in which case the company would need to be appropriately licensed under the Financial Institutions Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, cryptocurrencies aren\'t considered investment instruments under the Investment Services Act and don\'t trigger any licensing requirements under the act.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cryptocurrency taxation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In explaining Malta’s tax policy, three MEPs, David Casa, Roberta Metsola and Francis Zammit Dimech said “We will never allow the EU to decide on behalf of the Maltese people on how to run our tax systems. That was, still is, and must remain, the competence of the respective governments.”   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Maltese has no tax legislation regulating cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange.

The Monero cryptocurrency provides anonymity without tumbling services due to its privacy centric design, utilizing ring signatures to keep the entire blockchain secure and untraceable. He pointed to the need for adopting crypto regulations at an EU and maybe even at a G-20 level to have mixing services recognized as money-laundering and tax evasion indicators, with users of mixing services assumed to be guilty of these offenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The power to levy taxes, including cryptocurrency taxes, is central to the sovereignty of EU Member States, which have assigned only limited competences to the EU in this area.  The EU lacks a uniform tax regulator. Therefore, aggressive tax planning by multinational crypto-businesses is monitored by the EU Anti-Trust Commission which is in charge of policing state aid that skews competition within the EU.  Ricardo Cardoso spokesperson handling Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s portfolio said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“The Commission has no ongoing investigations concerning cryptocurrency related issues and we would never speculate on such matters.”</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Accordingly, TAX3 was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/illicit-uses-of-cryptocurrency-gaining-attention-around-the-world-expert-take">established</a> by the European Parliament on March 1, 2018 in response to continued revelations over the last five years via LuxLeaks, the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers which shed light on the rampant tax evasion, money laundering and corruption at EU Member States, that have independent citizenship programs, tax and policies. As Dariusz Rosati MEP, EPP Group Spokesman in the Special Committee on Financial Crimes, Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance, said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“For me, selling EU citizenship does not only mean enabling the rich to free-ride on our common European assets. It also allows the rich to escape sanctions or launder money. Take the example of Malta which uses citizenship in exchange for investments program to attract investments, where rich Russian citizens - who potentially could be targeted by further sanctions - are amongst the nationalities that most frequently receive Maltese - therefore European - citizenship.”</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">TAX3’s mission is to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir="ltr">\n<li>Contribute to the ongoing debate on taxation of the digital economy, including VAT;</li>\r\n\t<li>Assess national schemes providing tax privileges (such as sale of citizenship programs);</li>\r\n\t<li>Follow closely the ongoing work of, and contribution by, the Commission and Member States in international institutions, including the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), G20, UN and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) regarding taxation/cryptocurrency matters.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The TAX3 Committee has a twelve-month mandate. At the end of this period, it will submit a report with findings and recommendations to do more to fight tax crimes, tax evasion and tax avoidance in EU to set the stage for fairness in tax competition with many EU Member States.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Investigations –like TAX3--could lead to a lasting split in cryptocurrency markets, as exchanges face the choice of whether to comply with mounting regulatory demands” cautioned Cornell professor and computer scientist Emin Gun Sirer who is the co-founder of a peer-to-peer virtual currency system called Karma, which pre-dates Bitcoin by seven years.  “Exchanges will go one of two ways,” Sirer said. “Either they will clean their act, by first shopping for the most lenient jurisdictions with relevant KYC/AML and tax laws or they\'ll go ‘fully underground,’ and operate with no rules, behind Tor and other anonymous communication technologies” with mixing capabilities to evade KYC/AML and tax laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, many exchanges from Asia and EU after shopping around for the most tax and regulatory lenient crypto jurisdiction have set up shop in Malta.  As a result, according to a study conducted by Morgan Stanley, Malta now accounts for the largest share of cryptocurrency trading volume in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Malta is a global trailblazer in crypto blockchain and ICO regulation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Malta\'s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has described his country as the global trailblazer in the regulation of blockchain-based businesses and the jurisdiction of quality and choice for world class fintech companies.  Muscat ties Malta’s success to becoming a member of EU’s Blockchain Partnership; it’s three new cryptocurrency bills  adopted by parliament on April 24; as well as it’s favorable crypto tax policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bills grant regulatory power to the Malta Financial Services Authority  to publish and enforce specific rules regarding cryptocurrencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Malta Digital Innovation Authority Bill.</strong> It establishes the Malta Digital Innovation Authority, which on a voluntary basis, will certify blockchain platforms to ensure credibility and provide legal assurances regarding cryptocurrencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Innovative Technology Arrangements Bill.</strong> It provides a framework for the registration of technology service providers and the certification of technology arrangements concerning system administrators and auditors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Services and Virtual Financial Asset Bill.</strong> It provides the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cryptocurrencies are currently unregulated under Maltese law and exchanges of cryptocurrencies are deemed equivalent to commodity trading. A company utilizing  cryptocurrencies isn\'t required to obtain a license from the Malta Financial Services Authority unless it qualifies as a collective investment scheme or carries on the business of a financial institution or payment service provider, in which case the company would need to be appropriately licensed under the Financial Institutions Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, cryptocurrencies aren\'t considered investment instruments under the Investment Services Act and don\'t trigger any licensing requirements under the act.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cryptocurrency taxation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In explaining Malta’s tax policy, three MEPs, David Casa, Roberta Metsola and Francis Zammit Dimech said “We will never allow the EU to decide on behalf of the Maltese people on how to run our tax systems. That was, still is, and must remain, the competence of the respective governments.”   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Maltese has no tax legislation regulating cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange. Only if the sale of cryptocurrency is done on a habitual basis and/or the length of ownership is very short, the consideration of the sale may be considered as being income and therefore subject to income tax at 5 percent” <a href="https://ellulschranz.com/team_member/mariella-baldacchino/" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">said</a> Dr. Mariella Baldacchino B.A, LL.D of E&amp;S Consultancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, “The Maltese Value Added Tax (VAT) Department follows the European Court of Justice judgment in Hedqvist (C-264/14).   Therefore, transactions to exchange fiat currencies for units of cryptocurrency and vice versa are exempt from VAT as well” added Baldacchino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, the US customers/investors of Maltese crypto-exchanges/crypto-funds <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/virtual-currency-exchanges-and-us-customers-beware-irs-is-coming-expert-blog">should keep</a> in mind their US tax obligations, including Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) tax reporting requirements as reiterated by the AICPA in its <a href="https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/20180530-aicpa-comment-letter-on-notice-2014-21-virtual-currency.pdf" rel="nofollow,noopener" target="_blank">second letter</a> to the IRS.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Selva Ozelli</strong>, Esq., CPA is an international tax attorney and CPA who frequently writes about tax, legal and accounting issues for Tax Notes, Bloomberg BNA, other publications and the OECD.</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n',
